## TV2.0 Multi-Subscriber Exmaple
This prefab is a variation on the standard, and mostly provided as a learning example on how to hook up multiple modules to a single TV. This prefab also features two additional video players to swap between: A multi screen player (one big screen with two smaller screens to the sides), and an implementation of the default Unity player (as opposed to the usual AVPro backend).

## TV2.0 Custom TV Model
This prefab is a variable on the standard, but features a custom TV model instead of the old box/quad primitives setup from 1.x. Each of the screen meshs are updated to the TV's screen mesh for seemless positioning. It uses the General Controls plugin.

Here's what it can look like:

## TV2.0 Slim (Recommended by Developer for Most Worlds)
This prefab is a model-less variation on the standard. It uses no "physical" models, just the screens. It comes with the Slim Controls plugin.

Here's what it looks like playing a video:
